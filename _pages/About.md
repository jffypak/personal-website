## About me

I’m Jeff. 

I like building things, solving problems, and spending time with good people. Preferably all at the same time! 

I've worked at Atlassian, Etsy, Betterment, and GitLab. I'm currently thinking through AI systems and how to make them better, with a particular interest in context and memory.

This site holds some essays that reflect what I think about.
